# GPT3-Domain-Generator

<h1>Introduction</h1>
This script is a domain availability checker that uses GPT-3 to generate unique business name ideas based on the keywords and a short description provided by the user. The script first prompts the user to enter keywords related to their business and a short description about their business. The script then uses the OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate name ideas based on the user's input. The script then checks the availability of the generated names using a domain availability checker API. The script prints the results of the availability check for each name idea, indicating whether the domain is available or not. 

</h1>Usage</h1>
1.) pip install -r requirements.txt
2.) enter your OpenAI API key in main.py
3.) python3 main.py
4.) enter keywords
5.) enter short business description
6.) wait for results
